### Project Description
Intralogistics plays a crucial role in optimizing internal logistic
processes in manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution. The project is done with Turtlebots which are low-cost, modular mobile
robots that can navigate autonomously in dynamic environments.
The programming is carried out using the open-source ROS2 (Robot-Operating System) framework, which provides a robust and flexible infrastructure for developing complex robotic systems. In this project, we explore the use of Turtlebots and ROS2
to develop an intralogistics system that can efficiently transport goods within a warehouse or production facility. 
The system is designed to be scalable and adaptable, capable of optimizing paths, avoiding collisions, and adapting to changing environments.
